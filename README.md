🌿 Plant Disease Prediction Web Application
A machine learning-powered web app that allows users—especially farmers and agricultural experts—to identify plant diseases from leaf images using a custom ResNet model. Built using Flask and deployed with an intuitive front-end interface.

🔍 Features
Upload leaf images and detect plant disease.

Utilizes a trained ResNet-based model with TF-IDF preprocessing.

Clean and simple UI with real-time predictions.

Ideal for early detection and improved agricultural decision-making.
